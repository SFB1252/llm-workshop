We explicitly invite submissions from students and researchers across all career stages. We are also explicitly welcoming posters that present work in progress and new ideas. There will not be a formal review process.</p> <p>We invite poster submissions on any topic related to the use of LLMs in language and cognitive sciences, including but not limited to:</p> <ul> <li>Methodological and theoretical challenges: e.g. reproducibility, good research and open science practices, evaluating LLM output.</li> <li>Cognitive and psycholinguistic implications of LLM-based language processing.</li> <li>Identifying and mitigating biases in LLMs for linguistic analysis.</li> <li>Using LLMs as tools for automatic annotation (e.g., phonetic, syntactic, discourse-level).</li> <li>LLM-based text, speech, or gesture analysis.</li> <li>Using LLMs for automatic stimulus generation or data augmentation.</li> <li>Using LLMs for studying cognitive and linguistic phenomena such as prominence.</li> </ul> <p>To present a poster, please submit a title by October 10, 2025 using this registration form.</p> <p>This workshop is organized by the Collaborative Research Center (CRC) 1252 \"Prominence in Language\" at the University of Cologne.
