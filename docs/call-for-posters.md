# Call for Posters

**Workshop: Large Language Models for Linguistic Analyses: Applications and Limitations**  
**24â€“25 November 2025 | University of Cologne**

We invite you for a two-day workshop exploring the applications, challenges, and implications of using Large Language Models (LLMs) in linguistic research.

This workshop brings together researchers of all career stages to discuss how LLMs can be used as tools for e.g. automatic annotation, text analysis, stimulus generation, while critically considering their cognitive plausibility and inherent biases.

Our invited speakers bring diverse expertise with talks from:

- Prof. Dr. Tatjana Scheffler (Ruhr University Bochum)
- Prof. Dr. Mark Dingemanse (Radboud University Nijmegen)
- Dr. Afra Alishahi (Tilburg University)
- Sam Boeve (University of Ghent)

The workshop is designed with a poster session at the center. We explicitly invite submissions from students and researchers across all career stages. We are also explicitly welcoming posters that present work in progress and new ideas. There will not be a formal review process.

We invite poster submissions on any topic related to the use of LLMs in language and cognitive sciences, including but not limited to:

- Methodological and theoretical challenges: e.g. reproducibility, good research and open science practices, evaluating LLM output.
- Cognitive and psycholinguistic implications of LLM-based language processing.
- Identifying and mitigating biases in LLMs for linguistic analysis.
- Using LLMs as tools for automatic annotation (e.g., phonetic, syntactic, discourse-level).
- LLM-based text, speech, or gesture analysis.
- Using LLMs for automatic stimulus generation or data augmentation.
- Using LLMs for studying cognitive and linguistic phenomena such as prominence.

To present a poster, please submit a title by **October 10, 2025** using [this registration form](https://survey.uni-koeln.de/index.php/612595?lang=en).

This workshop is organized by the **Collaborative Research Center (CRC) 1252 "Prominence in Language"** at the University of Cologne. We are committed to creating an inclusive and collaborative environment.

We look forward to seeing you!
