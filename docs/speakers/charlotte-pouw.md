## Talk:  Interpreting models for speech generation and understanding using methods from psycholinguistics

### Abstract (placeholder)
Alongside text-based LLMs, models for speech generation and understanding are rapidly improving.  To evaluate the extent to which these models exhibit human-like patterns in speech perception and production, we can treat them as psycholinguistic subjects and analyze their responses to carefully controlled stimuli. In this talk, I will present case studies that examine how well these models capture linguistic structures, focusing in particular on phonology and syntax.
