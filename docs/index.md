**24â€“25 November 2025 | University of Cologne**
**A Workshop organised by the SFB/CRC 1252: Prominence in Language**  

Large Language Models (LLMs) offer new ways for automatic text, speech, and gesture annotation, analysis, and generation. This two-day workshop brings together researchers of all career stages to explore the practical applications, methodological challenges, and theoretical implications of using LLMs for linguistic research.

Two important applications of LLMs include using LLMs as tools for linguistic research and using LLMs as cognitive models of language processing. This workshop will focus on using LLMs as tools all the while acknowledging that this requires us to critically consider their cognitive and psycholinguistic plausibility. How can LLMs be used as tools for automatic annotation, text analysis, generation, etc.? What are the cognitive and psycholinguistic implications of LLM-based language processing? What biases do LLMs introduce, and how can we deal with biases in automated linguistic analyses?

We have invited 4 speakers from computational linguistics, psycholinguistics, and digital humanities. They bring in expertise on psycholinguistic evaluation methods (Sam Boeve), transformer limitations and theoretical foundations (Afra Alishahi), reproducibility (Mark Dingemanse), and corpus linguistics (Tatjana Scheffler).
